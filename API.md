# Plotter Hub API

This document describes the public HTTP API exposed by Plotter Hub for external clients (companion apps, CLI tools, scripts). All public endpoints live under the `/api/v1/` prefix and require an API key.

The web UI uses a separate, unauthenticated set of routes (e.g. `/jobs`, `/upload`, `/queue/*`). Those are an internal contract between the bundled HTML and the server — they may change without notice. **Build against `/api/v1/*` only.**

## Base URL

```
http://<your-pi-hostname>.local
```

Default port is 80. If port 80 is unavailable at install time, the installer falls back to 8080 (`http://<host>.local:8080`).

## Authentication

Every request to `/api/v1/*` must include the API key in an `X-API-Key` header.

```
X-API-Key: <your-key>
```

The key is generated automatically the first time the service starts and is persisted in `config.json`. To find it:

- **From the UI** — gear icon → Settings → "API Key" section (last item, collapsed by default). Use the *Copy* button.
- **From the host directly** — read the `api_key` field in `~/PlotterHub/config.json` on the Pi.

To rotate the key, edit `config.json` on the Pi (or delete the `api_key` line so a new key is generated on next start) and restart `plotterhub.service`.

### Errors

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `401 Unauthorized` | `X-API-Key` is missing or doesn't match. |
| `400 Bad Request` | Validation failure — invalid SVG, unknown paper preset, malformed metadata JSON. |
| `404 Not Found` | The job ID doesn't exist (for per-job endpoints). |
| `409 Conflict` | The action isn't valid in the current state (e.g. editing a plotting job — once those endpoints exist). |
| `503 Service Unavailable` | Server hasn't initialized the API key yet. |

Errors come back as `{"detail": "..."}`.

## Endpoints

### `POST /api/v1/jobs` — add a job

Adds a new job to the queue. Accepts `multipart/form-data` with two parts:

| Part | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `file` | file | yes | The SVG. Must contain at least one Inkscape layer. |
| `metadata` | text (JSON) | no | Job metadata — see schema below. Omit entirely to use auto-detected defaults. |

#### Metadata schema

All fields are optional. Unspecified booleans, speeds, and `selected` flags fall back to server-side defaults (see `GET /api/v1/settings`).

```jsonc
{
  "name": "string",                   // Display name; replaces filename in the job card header.

  "paper_size": {
    "name": "string",                 // e.g. "A3", "Letter", or a custom label like "Square".
    "width": 200.0,                   // Numeric. Required if `height` is given (and vice versa).
    "height": 200.0,
    "unit": "mm" | "cm" | "in",       // Default "mm". Applies to width/height.
    "orientation": "portrait" | "landscape"  // Optional; swaps width/height if it disagrees.
  },

  "paper": {                          // Optional — the paper *stock*, not its size.
    "name": "FABRIANO Black Black 300g"  // Display only; shown under the preview, opposite the size.
  },

  // Job options — omit any field to inherit the corresponding server default.
  "pause_between_layers": true,       // Pause for pen change between selected layers (multi-layer only).
  "pause_after_job":      true,       // Pause after this job finishes (paper / pen swap before next).
  "delete_on_complete":   false,      // Auto-remove the job and its uploaded SVG once complete.

  // Request-only directive (not stored on the job record). When `true` AND
  // no other job is in a runnable or in-progress state (queued / paused /
  // plotting / planning / optimizing / homing / awaiting_pen_change), the
  // worker is started so this job plots immediately. Terminal-state leftovers
  // (`completed` / `failed` / `cancelled`) are inert and do *not* block
  // auto_plot. If a runnable/in-progress job exists, auto_plot is ignored —
  // you'd need to wait for it to finish or hit `/queue/plot` yourself.
  "auto_plot": false,                 // Default false.

  // Plotter speed — omit any field to inherit the server default.
  // Out-of-range values are silently clamped to the bounds.
  "speed_pendown": 30,                // 1–100
  "speed_penup":   80,                // 1–100
  "acceleration":  50,                // 1–100

  // SVG optimization (vpype). Omit any field to inherit the server default.
  // The optimized SVG is cached per job and reused across re-plots; changing
  // any field below invalidates the cache and re-runs the pipeline.
  "optimize_svg":              true,  // Master toggle. When false the rest is ignored.
  "optimize_svg_tolerance_mm": 0.10,  // 0.01–10.0; used by linemerge + linesimplify.
  "optimize_svg_linemerge":    true,  // Stitch lines whose endpoints are within tolerance.
  "optimize_svg_linesimplify": true,  // Reduce vertex count (Douglas-Peucker).
  "optimize_svg_linesort":     true,  // Reorder lines to cut pen-up travel.
  "optimize_svg_reloop":       true,  // Randomize closed-path start (cosmetic).

  "layers": [                         // Per-layer overrides keyed by SVG layer index.
    {
      "index": 0,                     // Required — the 0-based Inkscape layer index.
      "name": "string",               // Optional — overrides the embedded `inkscape:label`.
      "type": "pattern" | "text" | "svg" | "calibration" | "image",  // Optional — drives a small icon in the UI. Other values are accepted and fall back to a generic icon.
      "selected": false,              // Optional, default true. `false` excludes the layer from the plot.
      "speed_pendown": 25,            // Optional 1–100 — pen-down speed for this layer only.
      "speed_penup": 75,              // Optional 1–100 — pen-up speed for this layer only.
      "acceleration": 75,             // Optional 1–100 — acceleration for this layer only.
      "pen": {                        // Optional — the pen loaded for this layer.
        "name": "Uni Posca PC-5M White"  // Display only; shown after the layer name.
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Paper size resolution

- **Metadata omitted, or `paper_size` omitted** — paper dimensions are taken straight from the SVG's `width`/`height` attributes (parsed via the SVG's units / `viewBox`). Orientation is implicit in those dimensions: portrait if `width ≤ height`, landscape otherwise. If the resulting size matches a known preset (A0–A5, B0–B5, Letter, Legal, Ledger, ANSI C–E), the web UI labels the job accordingly; otherwise it's shown as a custom size with the raw mm.
- **`paper_size.name` set, `width`/`height` omitted** — `name` must match a known preset (see list below); preset dimensions are used.
- **`paper_size.width` and `paper_size.height` set** — those values are used after unit conversion. `name` is preserved as a display label only.
- **`paper_size.orientation`** — if given, the resolved dimensions are swapped if needed so `width >= height` (landscape) or `width <= height` (portrait).

Known presets: `A0`–`A5`, `B0`–`B5`, `Letter`, `Legal`, `Ledger`, `ANSI-C`, `ANSI-D`, `ANSI-E`. Any other `name` without explicit dimensions returns `400`.

##### Paper stock and pens

`paper.name` and `layers[].pen.name` are free-form descriptive strings — they don't affect plotting, they just record what's physically loaded. Both are optional; omit them and the web UI shows nothing in their place. They are stored on the job record as `paper_name` and, per layer, `pen_name`.

In the web UI the paper stock appears under the page preview, right-aligned opposite the paper size. And the pen name trails its layer's name in the layer list:


##### Layer overrides

`layers[]` is keyed by `index` (matching the SVG's Inkscape layer order, 0-based). Layers not listed keep the SVG's embedded `inkscape:label`, have no `type`, and are **selected** by default. Listed layers can override `name`, `type`, and `selected` independently — supplying only `type` keeps the embedded label, and supplying only `selected: false` excludes the layer from the plot. If every layer is deselected the request returns `400`.

`pen.name` is a display-only note of the pen loaded for that layer — see [Paper stock and pens](#paper-stock-and-pens).

`speed_pendown`, `speed_penup`, and `acceleration` are optional per-layer speed overrides: when set, they take precedence over the job's (document) and the system's speed settings for that layer only. Each axis falls back independently, so you can override just one. Out-of-range values are clamped, not rejected.

Because a layer can only carry its own speed when it's plotted as a separate stage, **any** layer speed override forces per-layer staging — the layers plot as back-to-back stages even when `pause_between_layers` is `false` (the pen returns to the home corner between them). Note that the plot-time estimate is computed once at the job's base speed, so it is approximate when per-layer overrides are in play.

Layer types are decorative — the icon is shown in the layer list:

| Type | Meaning | Icon (web UI) |
|---|---|---|
| `pattern` | Generative / decorative pattern | waveform |
| `text` | Text rendered as paths | text bars |
| `svg` | A vector glyph or composed shape | triangle/circle/square |
| `calibration` | Registration / alignment marks | scope (crosshair-in-circle) |
| `image` | A raster / photo-derived layer | photo (mountains & sun) |

#### Response

`200 OK`, JSON, the full job record:

```jsonc
{
  "job_id": "abc12345",               // Job ID — use this for future per-job actions.
  "status": "queued",
  "created_at": 1777212168.88,
  "svg_id": "1ebd8a27",
  "filename": "APITest.svg",
  "name": "API Test (via GD Studio)",
  "paper_size_name": "A3",
  "paper_name": "FABRIANO Black Black 300g",  // null when `paper` was omitted.
  "layer_selections": [
    { "index": 0, "label": "Guilloché", "type": "pattern", "pen_name": "Uni Posca PC-5M White" },
    { "index": 1, "label": "Text",      "type": "text" },   // `pen_name` absent when `pen` was omitted.
    { "index": 2, "label": "Logo",      "type": "svg" }
  ],
  "paper_width_mm": 420.0,             // Always millimetres, regardless of input unit.
  "paper_height_mm": 297.0,
  "pause_between_layers": true,       // From server-side defaults (Settings).
  "pause_after_job": true,
  "delete_on_complete": false,
  "speed_pendown": 25,
  "speed_penup": 75,
  "acceleration": 75
  // ... margins, transforms, timing fields, etc.
}
```

#### Example

```bash
curl -X POST http://plotterhub.local/api/v1/jobs \
  -H "X-API-Key: $PLOTTERHUB_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/drawing.svg" \
  -F 'metadata={"name":"Nightly run","paper_size":{"name":"A3","orientation":"landscape"},"paper":{"name":"FABRIANO Black Black 300g"},"layers":[{"index":0,"name":"Outline","type":"pattern","pen":{"name":"Uni Posca PC-5M White"}},{"index":1,"name":"Title","type":"text"}]}'
```

If your shell mangles the inline JSON (extra spaces, broken backslash continuations), put the JSON in a file and reference it:

```bash
curl -X POST http://plotterhub.local/api/v1/jobs \
  -H "X-API-Key: $PLOTTERHUB_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/drawing.svg" \
  -F "metadata=<./metadata.json"
```

### Queue control

All endpoints take no body, return `{"ok": true}` on success, and respond `409 Conflict` (with a `detail` message) when the action isn't valid in the current state.

| Method | Path | What it does | 409 conditions |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/queue/plot` | Start the queue. Picks up the first queued job. | No queued job; queue already running. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/queue/pause` | Pause the active plot. Pen is raised; resumable. | No actively-plotting job. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/queue/pause-at-pen-up` | Soft pause: defer until the next pen lift, so the pen doesn't stop mid-stroke (useful for pump-action pens). Pauses immediately if the pen is already up. While pending, the snapshot field `pause_at_pen_up_pending` is `true`. | No actively-plotting job. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/queue/resume` | Resume a paused plot. | No paused job; missing resume data. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/queue/continue` | Advance past a pen-change pause, or accept the next job after `awaiting_next_job`. | Nothing waiting on a continue. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/queue/calibrate` | At a pen-change pause, plot every layer with `type: "calibration"` (regardless of `selected`) as a one-shot side plot, then return to `awaiting_pen_change`. Lets the user verify pen alignment between layers without advancing the main plot. | Active job is not in `awaiting_pen_change`; job has no calibration-typed layers. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/queue/cancel` | Cancel the active job (or the awaiting-next-job state). The plotter homes if it can. | No active job. |

                                                        plotting_calibration ─────┘      │

```

`plotting_calibration` is entered from `awaiting_pen_change` via `/queue/calibrate`. It's a self-contained side plot of the calibration-typed layers; on completion the worker returns to `awaiting_pen_change` and the user can calibrate again, continue, or cancel.

`optimizing` is only entered when the job has `optimize: true` AND its cached
optimized SVG either doesn't exist or was produced with different parameters.
On subsequent re-plots of the same job the cache is reused and the worker
goes straight to `planning`.

#### Example

```bash
curl -X POST http://plotterhub.local/api/v1/queue/plot \
  -H "X-API-Key: $PLOTTERHUB_API_KEY"
```

### Per-job CRUD

All routes require `X-API-Key`. Job IDs are 8-hex-char strings returned from `POST /api/v1/jobs`. A `404 Not Found` is returned if the job ID doesn't exist.

#### `GET /api/v1/jobs` — list

Returns the full queue snapshot, mirroring what the WebSocket broadcasts:

```jsonc
{
  "queue":   [ /* array of job records, in queue order */ ],
  "active_id": "abc12345",          // null if no active job
  "awaiting_next_job": false,       // true between jobs when pause_after_job=true
  "status": "plotting"              // top-level worker status
}
```

#### `GET /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}` — get one

Returns the full job record (same shape as the `POST /api/v1/jobs` response).

#### `PATCH /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}` — edit

Body is JSON. All fields optional; only the fields you send are applied. To clear a nullable field (e.g. `paper_size_name`), send it explicitly as `null` — *omitted* fields are ignored, *null* fields are cleared.

Numeric fields with a documented range below (margins, transforms, plotter speeds, optimize tolerance) are silently clamped to the nearest bound rather than returning `400`. Margins are floored at `0`; `transform_offset_x_mm` / `transform_offset_y_mm` are clamped to `±paper_width_mm` / `±paper_height_mm`.

Editable fields:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string \| null | Display name override. |
| `paper_size_name` | string \| null | Display label for the paper size. |
| `paper_name` | string \| null | Display label for the paper stock (e.g. `"FABRIANO Black Black 300g"`). |
| `paper_width_mm`, `paper_height_mm` | number | Paper dimensions; always in mm. |
| `margin_top_mm`, `margin_right_mm`, `margin_bottom_mm`, `margin_left_mm` | number | |
| `fit_content` | bool | Scale SVG to fit the printable area. |
| `transform_scale` | number | 0.01–5.0 |
| `transform_rotation_deg` | number | 0–360 |
| `transform_offset_x_mm`, `transform_offset_y_mm` | number | |
| `speed_pendown`, `speed_penup` | int | 1–100 |
| `acceleration` | int | 1–100 |
| `pause_between_layers`, `pause_after_job`, `delete_on_complete` | bool | |
| `optimize_svg` | bool | Run the vpype optimization pipeline before planning. |
| `optimize_svg_tolerance_mm` | number | 0.01–10.0 |
| `optimize_svg_linemerge`, `optimize_svg_linesimplify`, `optimize_svg_linesort`, `optimize_svg_reloop` | bool | Per-step toggles for the vpype pipeline. |
| `layer_selections` | array | `[{index, label, type?, selected?, pen_name?}]` — drives which layers plot. Entries with `selected: false` are kept in the list (so name/type metadata survives a toggle in the UI) but skipped when planning. |

Returns the full updated job record. **`409 Conflict`** if the job is currently active (`plotting`, `planning`, `paused`, `awaiting_pen_change`, `homing`).

A side-effect to be aware of: editing a job that's in a terminal state (`completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`) automatically transitions it back to `queued` so a re-plot doesn't need a separate `/requeue` call.

#### `POST /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}/move` — reorder

Body: `{"new_index": <0-based int>}`. Returns `{"ok": true}`. **`409 Conflict`** if the job is active.

#### `POST /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}/requeue` — re-queue

No body. Returns the updated job record. Idempotent on jobs that are already `queued` (returns the existing record). **`409 Conflict`** if the job is active.

#### `DELETE /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}` — remove

No body. Returns `{"ok": true}`. Removes the job from the queue **and deletes the uploaded SVG** plus all on-disk derivatives (preview / filtered / staged / resume). **`409 Conflict`** if the job is active.

### Live state stream

#### `WS /api/v1/ws/state`

Streams the same JSON messages the web UI consumes — every queue mutation, status change, and live pen-position tick.

**Authentication.** Either:

- `X-API-Key: <key>` header on the upgrade request (preferred), or
- `?api_key=<key>` query parameter (for clients like the browser `WebSocket` API that can't set custom headers on a handshake).

If the key is missing or wrong, the server **rejects the WebSocket upgrade with HTTP 403** — the connection is refused before any frames are exchanged.

#### Message shape

The first message after `accept()` is always a full `state` snapshot:

```jsonc
{
  "type": "state",
  "queue": [ /* job records */ ],
  "active_id": "abc12345",
  "awaiting_next_job": false,
  "status": "plotting",
  "error": null
}
```

Subsequent messages are either further `state` updates (whenever the queue or any job changes) or pen-position ticks:

```jsonc
{ "type": "position", "x_mm": 123.4, "y_mm": 56.7, "pen_down": true }
```

Clients should switch on `type` and treat unknown types as forward-compat noise.

#### Example (CLI)

`~/Desktop/Examples/plotterhub-api-test-ws.sh` — pure-stdlib Python wrapped in a shell launcher; streams every frame to stdout, pretty-printed. Honors `PLOTTERHUB_HOST` / `PLOTTERHUB_API_KEY` env overrides.

### Settings

Server-wide defaults that new jobs inherit (the same set the web UI exposes in its Settings modal).

#### `GET /api/v1/settings`

Returns the current snapshot. The `api_key` is never echoed back — clients already have it (they used it to authenticate this request).

```jsonc
{
  "plotter_model": 9,                           // 1–10 (see README for the model table)
  "handling": 1,                                // 1–4 NextDraw motion profile: technical / handwriting / sketching / constant speed
  "penlift": 1,                                 // 1 = model default, 3 = brushless upgrade on an AxiDraw
  "pause_between_layers_default": true,
  "pause_after_job_default": true,
  "delete_on_complete_default": false,
  "speed_pendown_default": 25,                  // 1–100
  "speed_penup_default": 75,                    // 1–100
  "acceleration_default": 75,                   // 1–100
  "optimize_svg_default": true,                 // Run vpype before plotting on new jobs
  "optimize_svg_tolerance_default_mm": 0.10,    // 0.01–10.0
  "optimize_svg_linemerge_default": true,
  "optimize_svg_linesimplify_default": true,
  "optimize_svg_linesort_default": true,
  "optimize_svg_reloop_default": true,
  "display_unit": null                          // null | "mm" | "cm" | "in" — UI labels only
}
```

`display_unit` only affects how the web UI renders paper-size and SVG-dimension labels. Internal storage and inputs always stay in mm. When the field is `null` (no preference saved yet), the browser picks an initial value from `navigator.language` (en-US → in, otherwise mm); once the user saves a choice it overrides the locale fallback on every subsequent load.

#### `PATCH /api/v1/settings`

Body is sparse JSON — only the fields you send are applied. Returns the new snapshot.

| Field | Range / Type |
|---|---|
| `plotter_model` | int 1–10 |
| `handling` | int 1–4 — NextDraw motion profile |
| `penlift` | int, `1` or `3` |
| `pause_between_layers_default` | bool |
| `pause_after_job_default` | bool |
| `delete_on_complete_default` | bool |
| `speed_pendown_default` | int 1–100 |
| `speed_penup_default` | int 1–100 |
| `acceleration_default` | int 1–100 |
| `optimize_svg_default` | bool |
| `optimize_svg_tolerance_default_mm` | float 0.01–10.0 |
| `optimize_svg_linemerge_default`, `optimize_svg_linesimplify_default`, `optimize_svg_linesort_default`, `optimize_svg_reloop_default` | bool |
| `display_unit` | `"mm"` \| `"cm"` \| `"in"` — UI display only. PATCH cannot clear it back to `null`; that state only exists before any value has been saved. |

Out-of-range values return `400`. The API key cannot be set through this endpoint — to rotate it, edit `config.json` on the Pi and restart the service.

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://plotterhub.local/api/v1/settings \
  -H "X-API-Key: $PLOTTERHUB_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"speed_pendown_default": 30, "delete_on_complete_default": true}'
```

### System

#### `GET /api/v1/version`

Returns the running Plotter Hub version (read from the `VERSION` file at install time):

```json
{ "version": "1.0.2" }
```

Useful for an "About" surface in your client and for compatibility checks against future API revisions.

#### `POST /api/v1/system/shutdown`

Powers off the Raspberry Pi. The HTTP response is flushed first, then the system halts roughly 1.5 seconds later (the service unit is also stopped along with the OS). No body; returns `{"ok": true}` immediately on dispatch.

**Be careful** — there's no abort once the request is accepted. The web UI guards this behind a confirmation modal; an external client should do the same. Don't issue a shutdown while a plot is running: the plotter is left wherever the pen happens to be, and on next boot the queue rehydrates with a paused job whose pen is no longer in a known position.
